# Jobi Job Board

## Overview

A job board website converted from a figma mockup. The project is built using React and incorporates TypeScript, Firebase, the React Context API, React Router and TailwindCSS and will be my largest project to date! It is currently still in progress and has minimal functionality, but that will change over time. Check back frequently for updates, I'm working on this almost every day! ðŸ˜Š

## Live site

The live site is here (please note the site is still very much under construction and will almost certainly have broken parts until complete!): https://jobi-board.netlify.app

## Designed with 

- React with TypeScript
- React Context API and React Router
- Firebase
- TailwindCSS
