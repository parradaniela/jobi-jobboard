# Jobi Job Board

## Overview

A job board website converted from a figma mockup. The project is built using React and incorporates TypeScript, Firebase, the React Context API, React Router and TailwindCSS! I styled the site mobile first to be fully responsive, all the while making use of reusable UI components to quickly build out different sections. I plan to continue returning to this project to add more pages and functionality over time, check back frequently to see the updates as they happen! ðŸ˜Š
